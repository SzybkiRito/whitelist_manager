<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is designed to automate the process of managing player admissions across various gaming servers. Recognizing the common use of whitelists to ensure an optimal gaming experience, this solution aims to streamline the traditional, often cumbersome methods of using Discord or forums for player approvals. Initially conceived to enhance the experience for FiveM servers, the website versatility allows it to be adapted for use with any game that employs a similar whitelist process. The code is open for customization, enabling users to tailor it according to their specific requirements.
